their PHI exposed. This came to light during an unrelated systems

The cybersecurity breach at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency was detected in September while the agency was undertaking a retrospective two-year review of employees downloading information in an effort to help minimize cyberthreats. The breach, flagged to Congress and three other government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, occurred in November 2015 when a former employee downloaded a large number of files onto two thumb drives before retiring from the agency. The OCC said data on the thumb drives were encrypted and there is no evidence that data taken by the employee were “disclosed” or “misused.”An OCC spokesman said the files included information “related to OCC activities and employees.” He said there is “no indication that there was bank customer information among the files removed.”The agency said that once it discovered the data breach, it immediately referred the case to the Treasury Department’s Inspector General’s office. The OCC review concluded it was a “major incident,” involving more than 10,000 records and potentially exposing personal information. The former employee was identified only as a retiree who downloaded the information shortly before leaving the agency. Government agencies are required to report all “major incidents” to Congress; this is the first time the OCC has done so. The OCC said the data breach hasn’t “adversely affected” the agency’s internal operations.""More Information: http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-bank-regulator-notifies-congress-of-majo... ","Media",""

According to the report, TIGTA found 326 unencrypted emails containing taxpayer data. 275 of the emails were sent internally within IRS, while 51 emails were sent outside of the agency’s network to non-IRS email accounts. Of those emails sent externally, 20 were sent to six IRS employees’ personal email accounts. The significance of where the emails were sent is relevant to the level of the security risk to the taxpayer data. The report noted that unencrypted emails sent within the IRS internal network were of lower risk because they remained behind the agency’s firewalls which greatly lowers the probability they could be accessed by a third party. However, the emails sent outside of the agency were exposed to greater risk, not only because they were not encrypted, but because they no longer had the protection afforded by the firewall. Additionally, for the emails sent to personal accounts, the report noted that per IRS policy, no officer or employee of the IRS may use a personal email account to conduct official business. 326 emails containing 8,031 different taxpayers’ data may not sound like much, but TIGTA had this to say about their findings"" - See more at: http://www.fedsmith.com/2016/11/20/ig-irs-employees-sent-unencrypted-ema...More information: http://www.fedsmith.com/2016/11/20/ig-irs-employees-sent-unencrypted-ema...","Media",""

On October 13, 2016, we learned of an unintentional disclosure of your Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) as a result of this mailing.Our investigation found that, while preparing the Evidence of Coverage documents for mailing, HICNs were inadvertently included in the electronic file sent to EmblemHealth’s vendor and were then disclosed on the external mailing label that was affixed to the package.What Information Was InvolvedGHI is required to assign each member a “mailing identifier” number, which is randomly selected and contains no member information. This mailing identifier helps us keep track of the mailings we send to you. In this instance, the “mailing identifier” that GHI intended to use was mistakenly replaced with your HICN, which mirrors your Social Security number. As a result, your proper name and address appeared on the external mailing label of the evidence of coverage documents, along with the nine digits of your Social Security number that were listed as the package number (PKG#) located above the barcode.

BlackHeart Records is an Independent label founded by Joan Jett and Kenny Laguna and has a good reputation as an established label with a range of well known artists.The data breach is a massive treasure trove for fans and cyber criminals alike. There are unreleased tracks, never before seen pictures, even rejection letters from 1980 when Joan Jett was trying to get a record deal.

"May 17, 2016","LinkedIn","Mountain View, California","HACK","BSO","117,000,000","Unknown","""A recent incident involving LinkedIn, the business-oriented social 
networking service, is showing that data breaches can cause big problems
 for companies and consumers — even years after the breaches take place.
 On May 17, 2016, LinkedIn discovered that information stolen in a 2012 
incident was being made available online, and notified site users immediately the next day about what happened and what they were doing to fix it.
In 2012, an alleged 117 million
 email and password combinations were stolen by hackers. At the time, 
LinkedIn issued a mandatory password reset for any accounts they thought
 were compromised; all LinkedIn members were encouraged to change their 
passwords as well, just in case.
Fast forward to present day, and the 2012 breach has come back to 
haunt LinkedIn. The stolen data popped up online, and in an e-mail to 
LinkedIn users sent on May 25, 2016, the company said the published 
information included email addresses, hashed passwords, and LinkedIn 
member IDs, which are an internal identifier LinkedIn assigns to each 
member profile. They immediately invalidated passwords of all LinkedIn 
accounts that were created prior to the 2012 breach and had not 
undergone a password reset since the breach.
LinkedIn’s attempts to protect users, however, are extending beyond 
resetting passwords this time. They are also using automated tools to 
try and identify (and block) any suspicious activity on specific 
LinkedIn accounts. The proper authorities have been contacted and 
LinkedIn is working with law enforcement. They have demanded that anyone
 making stolen password data available must stop immediately, or face 
potential legal action.
In their e-mail, the company also shared that they have improved 
security features since the 2012 breach, which will hopefully prevent 
another incident like this from happening in the future. As examples, 
they noted that they use salted hashes to store passwords and offer two-step verification
 for members who are interested in additional security. LinkedIn also 
encouraged members to use strong passwords and to change them regularly.
 If you don’t change your password often enough because you have trouble
 remembering new passwords, consider using a password manager, which can help you keep all of your passwords organized.""More information: https://www.identityforce.com/blog/linkedin-data-breach-continues-cause-...","Media",""

The site's security team investigated the matter as soon as it became aware of the incident.
“Our analysis gives us no reason to believe that this information was used to access Tumblr accounts,” the blog said. 
Officials said in the blog that those affected will be required to 
set a new password as a precaution. Users are instructed to visit the 
sites security page for more information on how to keep their accounts 
secure.""More information: https://www.scmagazine.com/tumblr-announces-email-credentials-compromise...UPDATE (5/31/2016):  ""More than 65 million Tumblr accounts from a 2013 breach were spotted for sale on the dark web. 
Security researcher and Haveibeenpwned
 owner Troy Hunt recently found a database containing the stolen account
 information for sale on a dark web market site and listed the breach on
 his own site as the third largest ever.
A hacker known as Peace was selling the database for $150, according to Vice's Motherboard.
 Peace told Motherboard the price is so low because the salted passwords
 are very difficult to crack however, Hunt told the publication roughly 
half of the passwords will likely be cracked due to weak password 
protections that were used at the time. 
On May 12, Tumblr notified
 users of the breach that compromised user email addresses with salted 
and hashed passwords from early 2013 and told users there is no reason 
to believe that the information was used to access their Tumblr 
accounts.
Although the breach isn't as bad as other major breaches, it has the 
potential to be dangerous for users who re-use passwords, Kaspersky Lab 
Senior Security Researcher Brian Bartholomew told SCMagazine.com via 
email. 
“If you were to think about how many users from Tumblr have Apple 
cloud accounts, Twitter accounts, Gmail or other online mail accounts, 
etc. the potential risk is high for this breach to bleed over into other
 stories down the road,” he said.  “These credentials could be used by 
criminals to access anything from bank accounts, to mail accounts, to 
other online systems that may house personal data / pictures / etc.”
